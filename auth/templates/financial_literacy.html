        <section>
            <h2>Gender Pay Gap</h2>
            <p>The gender pay gap is one of the most significant financial challenges women face. On average, women earn less than men for the same roles, which affects their ability to save, invest, and accumulate wealth.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Impact on Savings:</strong> Lower income means less money available for savings, which impacts long-term financial goals such as retirement.</li>
                <li><strong>Investing Challenges:</strong> With less disposable income, women may not have the resources to invest in assets such as stocks or real estate, limiting wealth accumulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-Term Financial Security:</strong> The gender pay gap can hinder women’s ability to secure financial independence and ensure a comfortable future.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Credit Score Disparities</h2>
            <p>Women often face challenges related to credit score disparities. Lower earnings and higher debt-to-income ratios are common, leading to a lower credit score, which can limit their access to loans and favorable interest rates.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access to Loans:</strong> A poor credit score may make it difficult for women to qualify for loans or obtain favorable terms for essential needs such as housing or education.</li>
                <li><strong>Higher Interest Rates:</strong> A low credit score often results in higher interest rates, making borrowing more expensive.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Restrictions:</strong> With limited access to credit, women may face difficulty in building a solid financial foundation or making large investments.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Career Breaks</h2>
            <p>Women are more likely to take career breaks for caregiving responsibilities such as raising children or caring for elderly family members. These breaks often result in lost income, reduced retirement savings, and gaps in professional experience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Impact on Income:</strong> Career breaks can lead to lost wages, which affects long-term savings and financial growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Retirement Savings:</strong> Time away from work can result in a reduced ability to contribute to retirement funds, which can impact financial security in later years.</li>
                <li><strong>Career Development:</strong> Career breaks may limit opportunities for career advancement, leading to stagnation in salary growth and professional experience.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Loss of Employment</h2>
            <p>Women often face higher vulnerability to job loss, particularly in less stable or lower-paying industries. The resulting economic instability can lead to financial hardships and disrupt well-planned financial goals.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Job Insecurity:</strong> Women working in industries with high turnover or instability may face sudden job losses, which impacts their income stability.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Stress:</strong> A loss of employment can create immediate financial stress, especially for women with dependents or other financial obligations.</li>

            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Overlapping Duties</h2>
            <p>Women often juggle multiple roles in their personal and professional lives, including professional, domestic, and caregiving responsibilities. These overlapping duties can limit the time and energy available for managing finances effectively.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time Constraints:</strong> The demands of work, family, and caregiving leave women with limited time to focus on managing their finances, which can affect their ability to save or invest.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Decision Fatigue:</strong> Constantly balancing multiple responsibilities can lead to fatigue, making it harder for women to make well-informed financial decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Focus:</strong> Women may struggle to allocate enough time to plan for long-term financial goals, resulting in missed opportunities for wealth accumulation and financial growth.</li>
